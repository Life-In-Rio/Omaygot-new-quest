  I'm scared (oh-oh-oh)
      
      It feels like you don't care (ooh-ooh) 

      Enlighten me,my dear (ooh-ooh-ooh) 

      Why am I still here? Mm (oh-oh) 

      I don't mean to be 

      Complacent with the decisions you made But why? 

      In the back of my mind,you died 

      And I didn't even cry No, not a single tear 

      And I'm sick of waiting patiently 

      For someone that won't even arrive 

      Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oh 

      In the back of my mind, I killed you And I didn't 

      even regret it I can't believe I said it But it's true I hate you
