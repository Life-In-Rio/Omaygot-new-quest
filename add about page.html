      I'm scared (oh-oh-oh) <br />
      
      It feels like you don't care (ooh-ooh) <br />

      Enlighten me,my dear (ooh-ooh-ooh) <br />

      Why am I still here? Mm (oh-oh) <br />

      I don't mean to be <br />

      Complacent with the decisions you made But why? <br />

      In the back of my mind,you died <br />

      And I didn't even cry No, not a single tear <br />

      And I'm sick of waiting patiently <br />

      For someone that won't even arrive <br />

      Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oh <br />

      In the back of my mind, I killed you And I didn't <br />

      even regret it I can't believe I said it But it's true I hate you
